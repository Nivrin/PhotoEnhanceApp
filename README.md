FastAPI Image Enhancement Flutter App
Overview
The FastAPI Image Enhancement Flutter App is a mobile application that allows users to select a photo from their device's gallery. Once a photo is chosen, the app sends a POST request to a FastAPI-based image enhancement service. The service processes the image, enhancing its quality by resizing, adjusting contrast and color saturation, and sharpening. The enhanced photo is then returned as a response.
